# sql-log-playercount
A short Bash x SQL script to log playercounts to MySQL (MySQL part is optional)

### Todo
- [ ] Finish the script (check all functions, also check SQL functions)
- [ ] Write a loop for ease of adding
- [ ] Write a Web panel that graphs (with log in and stuff)
- [ ] Maybe find a better way to organize the script for large server clusters (maybe have a miniscript just for SQL adding)
